Creating a simple bookstore website using HTML and CSS.

Creating a simple bookstore website using HTML and CSS involves structuring your HTML to include elements such as a 
header, navigation, book listings, and a footer, and then styling these elements with CSS.

HTML Structure:
-Header: Contains the logo, search bar, and navigation links (Sign In, Cart).
-Navigation Bar: Links to different book categories (Home, Fiction, Non-Fiction, Children's Books, Best Sellers).
-Main Content: Section for book listings, with each book having an image, title, author, price, and "Add to Cart" button.
-Footer: Simple footer with copyright information.

CSS Styling:
-Basic reset for margins and paddings.
-Styling for the body to set font family, line height, and background color.
-Header styling to set background color, text color, and layout (flexbox).
-Styling for navigation bar and links.
-Main content and book item styling to arrange books in a grid-like layout with box shadow for a card-like appearance.
-Footer styling to fix it at the bottom of the page.
